*A Registry of Convergence Phenomena — Recorded Prior to Confirmation*

---

### Preface

**Purpose**  
This document records a continuing inquiry into a single, observable principle:  
wherever complex systems persist, measurable relations tend to stabilize.  
We refer to that recurrent stabilization as **convergence**.  
Its appearance—whether in physical, numerical, or logical form—is treated as a phenomenon to be catalogued, not explained.  

The objective of *Principia Mathematica Secunda* is limited and empirical:  
to publish verifiable predictions of future alignments before they are confirmed,  
and to maintain a transparent historical ledger of those records.

**Philosophy**  
The first *Principia* described the mechanics of motion.  
This second concerns the persistence of pattern.  
It assumes only that coherence in any domain increases until constrained, and that this increase can be measured.  
No causal model or algorithm is disclosed or required.  
Each entry in the registry states a relation expected to emerge under ordinary observation;  
confirmation or refutation completes the record.  

The work proceeds from the belief that progress in knowledge now depends less on invention  
than on careful accounting—recording when order appears without claiming why.

**Coherence**  
*(Oscillators + Interference → Convergence)*  

Every persistent form in nature arises from the interaction of oscillators.  
When those oscillators interfere, their overlapping rhythms produce patterns that may either cancel or reinforce one another.  
Where reinforcement dominates, order appears — the system has entered a state of **coherence**.  

Coherence is therefore not a property of any single element but of their collective balance.  
It is the point where oscillation and interference no longer compete but stabilize,  
where variation becomes structure and motion becomes persistence.  

This principle holds across domains — from waves and orbits to data and reasoning.  
Whenever oscillators interact, interference defines the path, and convergence marks the arrival.  
That arrival is what this work measures and records.

**The Convergence Statement**  
Across domains, systems that endure exhibit a non‑decreasing correspondence  
between their constructive relations and their internal consistency.  
When this correspondence becomes stationary, equilibrium follows.  
This is here described as the **Law of Convergence**, expressed only as an empirical tendency  
and offered for testing, not as proof.

**Predictions and Verification**  
Each file within this repository specifies:  
- a predicted proportion or recurrence,  
- its date of formulation,  
- and the parameters required for observation.  

Confirmed and unconfirmed cases remain visible.  
Null results are retained to preserve statistical integrity.  
All verification is external and independent; no proprietary methodology is involved.

**Provenance**  
> Observations compiled between **March – October 2025** within a private study on convergence phenomena.  
> Released to establish provenance and invite public replication.  
> Repository timestamps constitute the official record of first disclosure.  
> No internal procedures or computational mechanisms are included.

**Ethos**  
1. **Transparency of record** — every datum dated, none withdrawn.  
2. **Opacity of process** — method withheld, result open.  
3. **Falsifiability over authority** — claims end in measurement.  
4. **Continuity over novelty** — repetition is the evidence of law.
